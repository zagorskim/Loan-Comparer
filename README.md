# Loan Comparer

## Introduction 
This is a project for Creating Web Applications with .NET Framework class at Warsaw University of Technology - Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science.

It is a website used for comparing different banks' offers for loans. 
A user can send an inquiry for a loan (with specified money amount, income etc.), then get offers from three different banks and choose one.

We have also implemented a bank API which takes inquiries and creates an offer based on them.

## Technologies
### Frontend
Frontend has been created using React.js.
### Backend
Backend and bank's API are based on ASP .NET 6 Web API.
